<p class="lead">The Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) is a document that describes how an information technology (IT) product, such as software, hardware, or web-based applications, meets the accessibility standards defined by Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. This VPAT describes the accessibility features of the ImageMagick open-source project.</p>
<ul>

<h5>Evaluation Methods Used</h5>
<p>This VPAT is based on a review of the ImageMagick project documentation, including the project website and the software documentation.</p>

<h6>Section 1194.21 - Software Applications and Operating Systems</h6>

<p>ImageMagick is a command-line utility for creating, editing, and converting images. The software can be used with screen readers and other assistive technologies to access the command-line interface. However, the interface is not optimized for use with assistive technologies, and some users may find it difficult to use without significant customization.</p>

<p>ImageMagick does not include any telecommunications features, so this section does not apply.</p>

<h6>Section 1194.24 - Video and Multimedia Products</h6>

<p>ImageMagick does not include any video or multimedia features, so this section does not apply.</p>

The documentation includes installation instructions, command-line reference, and other resources. However, some of the documentation may be technical and difficult for non-technical users to understand. The project does not offer any support services for users with disabilities.</p>

<h5>Conclusion</h5>

<p>ImageMagick is an open-source command-line utility that provides basic accessibility features for users who rely on assistive technologies. However, the software is not optimized for use with assistive technologies and may require significant customization to be accessible to all users. The project provides accessible online documentation, but may not be suitable for non-technical users.</p>
