<p>ImageMagick recommended practices <strong>strongly</strong> encourage you to configure a <a href="<?php echo $_SESSION['RelativePath']?>/../script/security-policy.php">security policy</a> that suits your local environment.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ImageMagick/MagickCache/">MagickCache</a> provides methods and tools to cache images, image sequences, video, audio or metadata in a local folder. Any content is memory-mapped for efficient retrieval. Additional efficiencies are possible by retrieving a portion of an image. Content can persist or you can assign a time-to-live (TTL) to automatically expire content when the TTL is exceeded. MagickCache supports virtually unlimited content upwards of billions of images making it suitable as a web image service.


<p>We discovered a bug in the pseudo-random generator prior to ImageMagick 7.0.9-11, the first 3 values repeated because the random state was not initialized properly.  As a consequence of the fix, expect a different numerical sequence when seeding (-seed).</p>

<p>As an analog to linear (RGB) and non-linear (sRGB) color colorspaces, as of ImageMagick 7.0.7-17, we introduce the LinearGray colorspace.  Gray is non-linear grayscale and LinearGray is linear (e.g. -colorspace linear-gray).</p>

<p>Now that ImageMagick version 7 is released, we continue to maintain the legacy release of ImageMagick, version 6, at <a href="https://legacy.imagemagick.org/">https://legacy.imagemagick.org</a>.  Learn how ImageMagick version 7 differs from previous versions with our <a href="<?php echo $_SESSION['RelativePath']?>/../script/porting.php">porting guide</a>.</p>

<p>The ImageMagick development process ensures a stable API and <a href="https://abi-laboratory.pro/tracker/timeline/imagemagick/">ABI</a>. Before each ImageMagick release, we perform a comprehensive security assessment that includes <a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer">memory error</a>, <a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizer">thread data race</a> detection, and continuous <a href="https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz">fuzzing</a> to detect and prevent security vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Want more performance from ImageMagick?  Try these options:</p>

<ul>
<li>add more memory to your system, see <a href="<?php echo $_SESSION['RelativePath']?>/../script/architecture.php#cache">the pixel cache</a>;</li>
<li>add more cores to your system, see <a href="<?php echo $_SESSION['RelativePath']?>/../script/architecture.php#threads">threads of execution support</a>;</li>
<li>reduce lock contention with the <a href="http://goog-perftools.sourceforge.net/doc/tcmalloc.html">tcmalloc</a> memory allocation library;</li>
<li>push large images to a solid-state drive, see <a href="<?php echo $_SESSION['RelativePath']?>/../script/architecture.php#tera-pixel">large image support</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If these options are prohibitive, you can reduce the quality of the image results.  The default build is Q16 HDRI.  If you disable <a href="<?php echo $_SESSION['RelativePath']?>/../script/high-dynamic-range.php">HDRI</a>, you use half the memory and instead of predominately floating point operations, you use the typically more efficient integer operations.  The trade-off is reduced precision and you cannot process out of range pixel values (e.g. negative).  If you build the Q8 non-HDRI  version of ImageMagick, you again reduce the memory requirements in half-- and once again there is a trade-off, even less precision and no out of range pixel values.  For a Q8 non-HDRI build of ImageMagick, use these <samp>configure</samp> script options: <samp>--with-quantum-depth=8 --disable-hdri</samp>.</p>
